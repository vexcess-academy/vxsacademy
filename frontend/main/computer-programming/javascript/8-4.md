# Intro
Preston is learning to read minds, although right now he's kinda just making random guesses. We're going to help him learn by getting him to guess a number in our head between 1 and 10:
```js
var ourNumber = 6; //change this to whatever number you want him to guess.
var hisGuess = random(1, 10); //the random function generates a random number between 1 and 10

fill(128, 0, 255);
textSize(30);
text("Preston: Is your number " + hisGuess + "?", 20, 100);
```
If you run that code, you'll see that it's not a whole number, but we want him to guess whole numbers. We can use the round function, which will round it to the nearest whole number:
```js
var hisGuess = round(random(1, 10)); //generates a random number between 1 and 10, and then rounds it to the nearest whole number
```
Ok so he's guessing random whole numbers. Now we need to check if he got it right, and say he got it right if he did, otherwise tell him to guess again.

# Else Statements
We *could* have an if statement to check if he got it right and another if statement if he got it wrong, but a better way is to use an else statement. An else statement works like this:
```js
fill(0, 255, 255);
var hasPancakes = false;

if(hasPancakes){
    text("Yay, pancakes!", 200, 200);
}else{
    text("Aw, no pancakes :(", 200 200):
}

//the code above and below work the same
if(hasPancakes){
    text("Yay, pancakes!", 200, 200);
}
if(!hasPancakes){
    text("Aw, no pancakes :(", 200 200):
}
```
The if statement will run **IF** the boolean is true, **ELSE** run the else statement. So in the pancakes example, the text will be sad that thereâ€™s no pancakes.

With the example with Preston, we can congratulate him if he gets it right, else, tell him to guess again:
```js
fill(255, 0, 0);
if(hisGuess === ourNumber){
    text("Us: Yay, you got it!", 20, 200);
}else{
    text("Us: No, guess again.", 20, 200);
}
```
So putting it all together:
```js
var ourNumber = 6; //change this to whatever number you want him to guess.
var hisGuess = round(random(1, 10)); //generates a random whole number between 1 and 10

fill(128, 0, 255);
textSize(30);
text("Preston: Is your number " + hisGuess + "?", 20, 100);

fill(255, 0, 0);
if(hisGuess === ourNumber){
    text("Us: Yay, you got it!", 20, 200);
}else{
    text("Us: No, guess again.", 20, 200);
}
```
Now the code's working how we want it to! You'll have to press the "run" button in order to get Preston to guess again. Preston is still bad at reading minds, but at least you learned more about programming!
