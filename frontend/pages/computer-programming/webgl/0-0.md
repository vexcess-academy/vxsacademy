## <div align='center'>About WebGL</div>

<br>WebGL is a rasterization API used for rendering graphics directly within a webpage, based off of OpenGL. WebGL uses JavaScript and offers many features, being widely used for 3D programs within HTML websites.<br><br>WebGL has two versions, the basic WebGL1, and WebGL2. WebGL2 is a more modern version that offers many more features compared to WebGL1. WebGL2 is backwards compatible with WebGL1 and is better, making WebGL1 pointless.<br><br>Both WebGL versions have extensions that provide additional features, but support for these extensions are quite limited. <br><br>**In this tutorial, we'll be strictly using WebGL2 and no extenstions.**<br><br>WebGL utilizes your computer's Graphics Processing Unit to rasterize pixels at lightning speeds. It takes information you provide and does math to color pixels.<br><br>Most modern browsers and machines support WebGL1. WebGL2's support may be less, but still quite high. It is supported by major browsers, but some require the experimental version.<br><br>WebGL programs run using a special shader language similar to C++, called Graphics Library Shader Language(GLSL). GLSL is a type-strict language used to write the vertex and fragment shaders of a WebGL program.<br><br>Most of the WebGL API is boilerplate code, and the rest is for rendering.
